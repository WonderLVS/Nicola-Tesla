            <h3>First steps</h3>
            <img src="NikolaTesla.jpg" alt="Nikola Tesla image" id="Photo">
            
            <p>
                Tesla was from a family of Serbian origin. His father was an Orthodox priest; 
                his mother was unschooled but highly intelligent. As he matured, he displayed 
                remarkable imagination and creativity as well as a poetic touch.
            </p>

            <p>
                Training for an engineering career, he attended the Technical University at Graz, 
                Austria, and the University of Prague. At Graz he first saw the Gramme dynamo, 
                which operated as a generator and, when reversed, became an electric motor, and 
                he conceived a way to use alternating current to advantage. Later, at Budapest, 
                he visualized the principle of the rotating magnetic field and developed plans 
                for an induction motor that would become his first step toward the successful 
                utilization of alternating current. In 1882 Tesla went to work in Paris for the 
                Continental Edison Company, and, while on assignment to Strassburg in 1883, 
                he constructed, after work hours, his first induction motor. Tesla sailed 
                for America in 1884, arriving in New York with four cents in his pocket, 
                a few of his own poems, and calculations for a flying machine. He first found 
                employment with Thomas Edison, but the two inventors were far apart in 
                background and methods, and their separation was inevitable.
            </p>

            <h3>Tesla vs Edison</h3>

            <p>
                In May 1888 George Westinghouse, head of the Westinghouse Electric Company 
                in Pittsburgh, bought the patent rights to Tesla`s polyphase system of 
                alternating-current dynamos, transformers, and motors. The transaction precipitated 
                a titanic power struggle between Edison`s direct-current systems and the 
                Tesla-Westinghouse alternating-current approach, which eventually won out.
            </p>

            <p>
                Tesla soon established his own laboratory, where his inventive mind could 
                be given free rein. He experimented with shadowgraphs similar to those that 
                later were to be used by Wilhelm Rontgen when he discovered X-rays in 1895. 
                Tesla`s countless experiments included work on a carbon button lamp, on the power 
                of electrical resonance, and on various types of lighting.
            </p>

            <p>
                In order to allay fears of alternating currents, Tesla gave exhibitions in his 
                laboratory in which he lit lamps by allowing electricity to flow through his body. 
                He was often invited to lecture at home and abroad. The Tesla coil, which he 
                invented in 1891, is widely used today in radio and television sets and other 
                electronic equipment. That year also marked the date of Tesla`s U.S. citizenship.
            </p>

            <p>
                Westinghouse used Tesla`s alternating current system to light the World`s Columbian 
                Exposition at Chicago in 1893. This success was a factor in their winning the 
                contract to install the first power machinery at Niagara Falls, which bore Tesla`s 
                name and patent numbers. The project carried power to Buffalo by 1896. In 1898 Tesla 
                announced his invention of a teleautomatic boat guided by remote control. When 
                skepticism was voiced, Tesla proved his claims for it before a crowd in Madison 
                Square Garden.
            </p>

            <h3>Hard times</h3>

            <p>
                Returning to New York in 1900, Tesla began construction on Long Island of a wireless 
                world broadcasting tower, with $150,000 capital from the American financier J. Pierpont 
                Morgan. Tesla claimed he secured the loan by assigning 51 percent of his patent rights 
                of telephony and telegraphy to Morgan. He expected to provide worldwide communication 
                and to furnish facilities for sending pictures, messages, weather warnings, and stock 
                reports. The project was abandoned because of a financial panic, labour troubles, 
                and Morgan`s withdrawal of support. It was Tesla`s greatest defeat.
            </p>

            <p>
                Tesla`s work then shifted to turbines and other projects. Because of a lack of funds, 
                his ideas remained in his notebooks, which are still examined by enthusiasts for 
                unexploited clues. In 1915 he was severely disappointed when a report that he and 
                Edison were to share the Nobel Prize proved erroneous. Tesla was the recipient of 
                the Edison Medal in 1917, the highest honor that the American Institute of Electrical 
                Engineers could bestow.
            </p>

            <p>
                After Tesla`s death the custodian of alien property impounded his trunks, which 
                held his papers, his diplomas and other honors, his letters, and his laboratory notes. 
                These were eventually inherited by Tesla`s nephew, Sava Kosanovich, and later housed 
                in the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade. Hundreds filed into New York City`s Cathedral 
                of St. John the Divine for his funeral services, and a flood of messages acknowledged 
                the loss of a great genius. Three Nobel Prize recipients addressed their tribute to "one 
                of the outstanding intellects of the world who paved the way for many of the technological 
                developments of modern times."
